Who Needs Light?,"Kathryn E. May, PsyD",0,0,0,"Who Needs Light? is a prescription for what ails ""the general suffering public"" in our families and communities throughout the world's philosophically Cartesian cultures where thought is seen as more valuable than emotion. Beginning with infant brain development, the author identifies startlingly familiar influences of Darkness from a new point of view--that of the difference between Head People and Heart People. The book includes a guide which defines the characteristics and habits of Abusive Personality Types. In lay terms, it shows how to identify and avoid these archetypal ""Children of Darkness"" wherever one might find them. Dr. May uses case studies, meditative exercises, original poetry, science and oral history to lead us step-by-step through the oppressive forces of materialism, self-centeredness and authoritarian religions which have shaped our present-day civilization. Her final vision is one of hope and radical spiritual evolution.","spirituality, Body, Mind & Spirit"

Hindu Kush-Himalaya Watersheds Downhill: Landscape Ecology and Conservation Perspectives,"Ganga Ram Regmi, Falk Huettmann",0,0,0,"This book describes the myriad components of the Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) region. The contributors elaborate on challenges, failures, and successes in efforts to conserve the HKH, its indigenous plants and animals, and the watershed that runs from the very roof of the planet via world-rivers to marine estuaries, supporting a human population of some two billion people. Readers will learn how the landforms, animal species and humans of this globally fascinating region are connected, and understand why runoff from snow and ice in the world’s tallest mountains is vital to inhabitants far downstream. The book comprises forty-five chapters organized in five parts. The first section, Landscapes, introduces the mountainous watersheds of the HKH, its weather systems, forests, and the 18 major rivers whose headwaters are here. The second part explores concepts, cultures, and religions, including ethnobiology and indigenous regimes, two thousand years of religious tradition, and the history of scientific and research expeditions. Part Three discusses policy, wildlife conservation management, habitat and biodiversity data, as well as the interaction of animals and humans. The fourth part examines the consequences of development and globalization, from hydrodams, to roads and railroads, to poaching and illegal wildlife trade. This section includes studies of animal species including river dolphins, woodpeckers and hornbills, langurs, snow leopards and more. The concluding section offers perspectives and templates for conservation, sustainability and stability in the HKH, including citizen-science projects and a future challenged by climate change, growing human population, and global conservation decay. A large assemblage of field and landscape photos, combined with eye-witness accounts, presents a 50-year local and wider perspective on the HKH. Also included are advanced digital topics: data sharing, open access, metadata, web portal databases, geographic information systems (GIS) software and machine learning, and data mining concepts all relevant to a modern scientific understanding and sustainable management of the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region. This work is written for scholars, landscape ecologists, naturalists and researchers alike, and it can be especially well-suited for those readers who want to learn in a more holistic fashion about the latest conservation issues.","spirituality, Science"

WomanSoul,"Carole A. Rayburn, Lillian Comas-Diaz",0,0,0,"As a path of meaning seeking, healing, and transformation, spirituality is becoming more prominent in our society. Historically, women have been the custodians of their families' spiritual domain. This book advances the concept of Woman Soul, a gender-specific way of embracing spirituality. WomanSoul discusses the personal and professional impact of spirituality in the lives of women from a variety of ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds. It examines the psychological, multicultural, and personal expressions of female spirituality. More specifically, the essays collected here look at the impact of women's spirituality on identity, healing, and transformation across the lifecourse. WomanSoul focuses on how females express spirituality from their diverse backgrounds and situated realities. It cuts across ethnic identities, culture, and a multitude of spiritual experiences, such as Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, Sufi, Goddess, Native American, and Agnosticism. As women tend to experience sacredness in a gender-specific manner, they frequently place more emphasis on spirituality than on religiousness. Seen as a freeing force by most women, spirituality is most often perceived to be more gender-fair, culturally liberating, and less restrictive than many religious denominations. Both informative and inspirational, WomanSoul is written by psychologists who understand the implications of spirituality on the lives of women and the people around them.","spirituality, Psychology"
