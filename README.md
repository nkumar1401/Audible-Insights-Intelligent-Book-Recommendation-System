# 🎧 Audible Insights: Intelligent Book Recommendation System

## 🚀 Vision
To revolutionize the digital reading experience by minimizing information overload through advanced AI/ML clustering and NLP techniques. This project serves as a foundation for a scalable recommendation ecosystem designed to dignify the human search experience.

## 🛠️ Project Overview
This application merges multiple Audible datasets to create a unified intelligence layer. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand book contexts and K-Means Clustering to group similar titles, providing users with hyper-personalized suggestions.

### Key Features:
- **Intelligent Merging:** Seamlessly combines catalog data with advanced feature datasets.
- **NLP Engine:** Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to process book descriptions and genres.
- **Clustering Logic:** Implements K-Means to identify latent patterns in literature.
- **Interactive EDA:** Real-time visualizations of rating distributions and author popularity.
- **Hidden Gem Detection:** Identifies high-quality, low-review books for unique discovery.
